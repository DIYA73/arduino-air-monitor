# 🌱 Air Quality Monitoring System (Arduino)

## 🚀 Overview

This project is an Arduino-based **Air Quality Monitoring System** designed to measure
environmental air pollution using gas and dust sensors.

The system displays real-time data on an I2C LCD and uses a servo motor for mechanical
response based on air quality levels.

⚠️ **Note:**  
This repository focuses on **code and system design only**.  
No physical hardware is required to view or understand the project.
